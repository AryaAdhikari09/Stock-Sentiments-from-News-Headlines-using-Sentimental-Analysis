# Extracting Stock Sentiments from News Headlines using Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project, investing insights are generated by applying sentiment analysis on financial news headlines from Finviz. By utilizing natural language processing techniques, the emotion behind the headlines is interpreted to predict market reactions towards stocks. This analysis helps in understanding whether the market sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral about a stock.

## Data Source
The datasets consist of raw HTML files for Facebook (FB) and Tesla (TSLA) stocks sourced from FINVIZ.com, a popular website dedicated to providing comprehensive stock information and news.
